  caption: The power of infinite random matrix theory comes from being able to systematically
    identify and work with non-crossing partitions (as depicted on the left). The
    figure on the right depicts a crossing partition which becomes important when
    trying to understand the higher order terms which infinite random matrix theory
    cannot predict. (Figure by Prof. Alan Edleman.)
